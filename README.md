Below is a brief description of the building of the Loan Approval Prediction Model:
Understanding the Problem and Data. It's important to understand the problem and what we aim to achieve.
Objective.  To predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on given applicant features.
Target Variable. The target variable is binary (approved/rejected), so this is a classification problem.
Loading and Exploring the Data. Load the dataset: This typically includes features such as: Applicant's income, Loan amount, Credit History, Education level, Dependants, Loan term and Property Area.
Exploring the data. I Used methods like head(), info() and isnull() to get a sense of the data's structure, data types, and any missing or anomalous values.
Data preprocessing: which is essential to prepare the data for model training. This includes: Handling missing values, imputing missing values using mean, median, mode or removing rows with missing data. One could also encode categorical variables using methods such as label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Splitting the Data: into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model(typically 70-80% of the data) while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance(the remaining 20-30%)
Model Selection: Selected model was Logistic Regression.
Training the Model selected, using the training data and evaluating it.
Deploying the Model to make predictions on new data.
